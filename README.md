# Room Learner Robot

This robot uses machine learning and sensors to map out and learn its environment. This robot will roam a room and detect obstacles, record its location, use the data a decision tree classification algorithm to build a model of the room. The robot will learn more about the room by utilizing machine learning, becoming more aware of the locations of objects in the room over time based on its trained model. The robot will even be able to recognize locations of objects ahead of time in order to avoid them. The process can be thought of as a pseudo-reinforcement learning algorithm by giving it a set of constraints such as avoiding known obstacles and allowing the robot to think for itself to test if the object is still there or not by trying to advance based on the accuracy of its predicted guess. The robot has to determine the mapping stationary objects vs moving ones (like a cat that walks by). This robot also has an obstacle avoidance protocol.
